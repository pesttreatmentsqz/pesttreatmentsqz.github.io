<p>Thus IPM is best mix of all possible methods in pest management with least reliance on chemical pesticide. Management decisions should be based on monitoring and population levels of insect pests, as well as trusted thresholds. IPM addresses all the financial, ecological, and social elements and offers inexpensive and safe food to the customers and profits to manufacturers and sellers, while preserving ecological health.</p>
<p>We first determine the pest concerns and then pick the best & reliable method to deliver the greatest quality service.

<p>Action Pest Control offers comprehensive bed bug control services including assessments carried out by extremely trained bed bug dogs and bed bug heat treatments administered by expert bed bug specialists. With more regulations on pesticide usage and a reduction in the number of active components in some crops, there is a greater focus on better understanding of readily available control options (Hillocks 2012 ). Regulative standards that restrict the use of specific pesticides or promote the use of others can have a significant influence on IPM implementation.</p>

Recently, the European Union has actually embraced IPM as a policy for management of insect pests. If outsourced, the food business must realize it has an equal function to play in pest control" with the pest management professional, says Dr. Siddiqi. </p>
