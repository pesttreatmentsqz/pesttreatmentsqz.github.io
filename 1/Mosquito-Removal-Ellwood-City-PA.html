<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family insect pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplistic definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost specifically about reducing pesticide use. If all other incorporated pest management strategies are not able to keep an insect pest population below a financial threshold, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>This in turn prevents weak plants which are more susceptible to pests and illness. Pest control measures may be carried out as part of an incorporated pest management strategy. Lots of countries have phased out broad-spectrum pesticides and fumigants. Applicators use a wider series of pesticides and handle more severe pests such as termites, along with fumigating homes to treat massive problems.</p>

When dispersed in the field or positioned in traps, baits containing toxic product will bring in and eliminate the pests. </p>
<p>Improvements in pest management are needed, and pesticides will likely constantly belong of the solution. The beginning point of any IPPM program is to determine which pests are a hazard to the building and its collections.
