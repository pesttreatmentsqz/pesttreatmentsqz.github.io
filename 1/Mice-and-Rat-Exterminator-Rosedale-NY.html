Broadcast spraying of non-specific pesticides is a last option. Integrated pest management was conceptualized throughout the 1950s when insecticide resistance, nontarget effects, and financial waste were plainly obvious (Stern et al., 1959).</p>
<p>The idea of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable strategy for handling pests, has actually been in practice for a long period of time. Crops genetically engineered to produce Bt contaminants are planted in countless hectares worldwide. Freezer is likewise thought about a physical control and, although it does not necessarily kill the insect pests, it at least stops their development and additional feeding on the saved crop.</p>
<p>The habits of the pest can be exploited for its monitoring and control through baits, traps, and mating interruption techniques (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ).
