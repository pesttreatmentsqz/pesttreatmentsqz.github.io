<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control household bug pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simple meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being practically exclusively about minimizing pesticide use. If all other integrated pest management methods are not able to keep an insect pest population listed below a financial limit, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent economic loss is justified.</p>
<p>1. Chemical Pest Control. Pests can be substantial obstacle to the growth of your business. However, some practitioners translate IPM as rotating chemicals from different mode of action groups to maintain pest control efficacy and decrease pesticide resistance with a focus on minimizing pest damage. Entomopathogenic nematodes can be utilized versus certain soil pests, bacteria, and infections versus pests with chewing mouthparts such as Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, while fungi are effective versus a range of pests.</p>
<p>. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a broad-based and sustainable approach that integrates practices for the economic avoidance and control of pests and illness in crops.  Special safety measures need to be taken to keep pest control treatments from threatening food safety. IPM is an information-intensive, site-specific, multitactic technique to pest control.</p>
<p>In Asia, numerous phases of IPM have actually been successfully embraced in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, vegetables), India (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, veggies), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (veggies, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997). </p>
