The launched sterilized insects ought to not be harmless or harmful to human beings and the environment. Red weaver ants, here eating a snail, have actually been used to control pests in China, Southeast Asia and Africa for lots of centuries.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was thus synonymous with "compatible."

<p>Tighter policies for food security, occupational health and safety, and the environment imply internal pest control isn't an option for many food businesses nowadays.
