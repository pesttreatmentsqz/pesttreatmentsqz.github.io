The launched sterilized insects ought to not be harmless or harmful to human beings and the environment. Red weaver ants, here eating a snail, have actually been used to control pests in China, Southeast Asia and Africa for lots of centuries.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was thus synonymous with "compatible."
