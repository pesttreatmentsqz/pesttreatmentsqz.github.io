A single identifying of any pest in a warehouse throughout an audit can indicate a lot of damage to the company-financial and reputation-wise. All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your personal belongings with harmful chemicals, damage the air quality in your home or business, potentially infect food and other perishables, and only kills pests at the surface of the problem.</p>

The chemical insecticides are used in a manner that is least disruptive to biological control.</p>
<p>The principle of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable strategy for handling pests, has been in practice for a long period of time. Crops genetically crafted to produce Bt toxins are planted in countless hectares worldwide.
