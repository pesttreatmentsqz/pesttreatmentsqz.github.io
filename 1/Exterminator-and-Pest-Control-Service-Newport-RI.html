<p>A typical pitfall most businesses face is describing their business name too actually by utilizing worn-out pest control terms like control, insecticide, management, and pesticide. The pest management market is large, with over 15,000 companies serving the general public and around 150,000 pest control service personnel. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, vermins, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow coats, flies and bees are frequently found pests in our society.</p>
<p>Part of this success came from field schools which allowed regional farmers to harness their native knowledge of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the selection and usage of pest control actions that will ensure favourable economic condition, eco-friendly and social effects 13 and is applicable to most agricultural, public health and amenity pest management circumstances.</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface area sprays and termite treatments, remain in the environment for days, weeks or even longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an essential component of an integrated pest management programme. However by focusing on non-chemical choices first, you can make sure that your pest management program is successfully removing pests at the least risk to your food security program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>
