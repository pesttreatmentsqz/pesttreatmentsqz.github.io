IPM considers the environment as a whole and thinks about a balanced mix of the previously mentioned control approaches to produce the most reliable and least destructive plan.</p>
<p>In Asia, numerous phases of IPM have been successfully adopted in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), India (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, veggies), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (vegetables, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997). </p>
