Integrated pest management (IPM) is a system of safeguarding crops that fulfills the requirements of sustainable development by enabling farmers to handle pests in a manner that is affordable, ecologically sound and suitable to adopt under regional conditions.</p>
<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Study Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to identify, manage, and minimize danger from pests and pest management tools and techniques in a manner that minimizes overall financial, health, and ecological risks.</p>

<p>Normally, the main aim of IPM programs is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ). Although, originally established for farming pest management, IPM programs are now developed to encompass illness, weeds, and other pests that may hinder the management objectives of sites such as residential and business structures, yard and turf areas, and home and community gardens.</p>
