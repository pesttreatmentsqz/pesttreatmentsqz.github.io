<p>This method refers to using a range of physical or mechanical methods for pest exemption, trapping (in some cases similar to the behavioral control), removal, or destruction (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exemption with netting or row covers, handpicking or vacuuming to eliminate pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying environmental conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, visual or physical bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic gadgets are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>

IPM thinks about the community as an entire and takes into consideration a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control approaches to produce the most effective and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>If, after following preventive and organized management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or apply selected biopesticides with low ecological impact. Professional exterminators utilize different kinds of pesticides and baits to kill and remove pests. Reliable, long-term corrective actions can then be required to avoid pests from getting in the structure and infesting the building and collections. </p>
