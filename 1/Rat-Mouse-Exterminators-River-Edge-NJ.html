The change to constant croppring systems over large surrounding locations has developed severe insect-pest management and control issues.</p>
<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and a few of the pesticides utilized in an organic system are as harmful to human beings and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides.
