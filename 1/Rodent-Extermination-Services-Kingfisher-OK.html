<p>Objective Declaration: The objective of Mosquito Control is to provide Leon County citizens with ecologically sound and reliable mosquito control services. Similar to us, pests need food, shelter, and water to make it through, and if they can't find these in your house, it's most likely they'll go somewhere else. If they can not enter it, pests can not endure without food and will not infest a building. Another method involves using baits that either ruin the pests or prevent them from recreating. C) Decrease in quantities of production and protection inputs of non-renewable resource origin (generally pesticides) while preserving steady productivity levels for the area.</p>
