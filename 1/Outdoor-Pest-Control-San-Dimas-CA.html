The concept of IPM is to monitor and control pests just when they start appearing and removing the over application of pesticides in the living environmentWe are well versed with IPM methods, Scope of works, application methods and industry specific record keeping treatments.</p>
<p>For instance, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Study Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that integrates biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to recognize, manage, and minimize risk from pests and pest management tools and techniques in a way that reduces general financial, health, and environmental risks.</p>
<p>To practice IPM in the landscape, select plants that are well suited to the site. Thankfully, we, today have many pest control companies all over India who are quite updated and efficient in getting rid of the issue of pests from our families and office. Most pest control companies run in basic service locations, so no travel costs must be examined within those areas. </p>
<p>Normally, the primary objective of IPM programmes is on farming insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, originally developed for agricultural pest management, IPM programmes are now developed to encompass diseases, weeds, and other pests that might interfere with the management objectives of websites such as commercial and residential structures, lawn and grass locations, and home and neighborhood gardens.</p>
