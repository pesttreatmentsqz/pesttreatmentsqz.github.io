<p>4 ). With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is deemed a ecologically benign and affordable  pest control method ideally suited for both little and big farmers around the world. Once termites have gone into a building, they do not limit themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more.

<p>On the other hand, organic food production applies a lot of the very same ideas as IPM but restricts using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to lower the need for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
