However, some professionals interpret IPM as turning chemicals from different mode of action groups to maintain pest control effectiveness and minimize pesticide resistance with a focus on decreasing pest damage.

<p>The term "integrated" was therefore synonymous with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be used only after regular tracking indicated that a pest population had reached a level (the economic threshold) that needed treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which economic losses would surpass the cost of the control measures.</p>

Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to decrease the need for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
