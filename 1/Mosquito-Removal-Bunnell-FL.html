Possibly biological control is most known for importation of natural enemies, often from the pest's area of origin, to control non-native pests (e.g., importing vedalia bettles to control cottony cushion scales which were attacking California citrus orchards).</p>

<p>The term "integrated" was thus synonymous with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be used only after routine tracking indicated that a pest population had reached a level (the economic threshold) that required treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which financial losses would go beyond the cost of the control procedures.</p>
<p>To practice IPM in the landscape, select plants that are well suited to the site.
