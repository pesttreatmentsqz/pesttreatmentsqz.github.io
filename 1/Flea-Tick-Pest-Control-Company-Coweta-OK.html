<p>Hey, I'm Ashley (Branding Specialist) and I'm going to direct you through our four actions to call your pest control business. A pest control employee is often referred to as an exterminator. A single spotting of any pest in a storage facility throughout an audit can mean a lot of damage to the company-financial and reputation-wise. All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your personal belongings with harmful chemicals, ruin the air quality in your home or business, potentially contaminate food and other perishables, and just kills pests at the surface area of the issue.</p>
