<p>The idea of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable strategy for handling pests, has actually remained in practice for a very long time. Crops genetically crafted to produce Bt contaminants are planted in millions of hectares worldwide.

<p>Biological control has been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve intrusive pest problems, classical biological control technique is usually utilized where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control method that has been efficiently utilized against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>

Most of insecticides fall under the chemical category since they are normally more reliable and can normally be utilized to control a number of pests. Physical barriers such as fences, nets, mulch, and tree trunk guards can exclude pests and minimize the damage they inflict.</p>
