<p>Because the term IPM has been coopted by the chemical industry to mean practically anything a professional wants it to mean, Beyond Pesticides has welcomed the phrase Ecological Pest Management." Ecological Pest Management better represents the focus professionals need to have -emphasizing the more comprehensive ecology of pest management and avoiding harmful chemicals unless there are no alternatives.</p>
<p>Integrated pest management means careful factor to consider of all offered plant defense approaches and subsequent integration of suitable procedures that dissuade the advancement of populations of harmful organisms and keep making use of plant defense products and other kinds of intervention to levels that are financially and ecologically warranted and reduce or minimise dangers to human health and the environment.</p>
