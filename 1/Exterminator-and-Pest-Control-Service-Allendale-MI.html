Each spider must be disposed of individually, either by physical contact (swatting it), by spraying it directly with bug spray, or picking it up and carrying it out of your home.">

<p>In contrast, organic food production uses a number of the very same ideas as IPM however restricts the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to lower the need for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
<p>Aids on pesticides were minimized from 75% in 1986 to 40% in 1987 and eliminated entirely by January 1989 (APO 1993). Biological control - suggests a common method of damaging pests as it takes place in nature. Early detection of arthropod pests helps prevent the requirement to handle substantial populations that might cause crop damage.
