<p>We got 195 mention of 200 in Integrated Pest Management. Pests are drawn in to several places that can offer any of thefollowing: food, water, shelter or all 3. If a number of the pests are killed, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the genetic basis of the future, more resistant, population.
