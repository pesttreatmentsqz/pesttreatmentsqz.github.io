<p>The goal of innovation need to be to protect and where possible boost production of healthy food per hectare, with minimal usage of synthetic fertilizer and chemical pesticides. If collective efforts were made due to the several potential causes for short and long-term health problems and signs associated with exposure to pests and pesticides, documents would be hard to obtain even.</p>
