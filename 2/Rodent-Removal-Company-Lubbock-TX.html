<p>The goal of innovation need to be to protect and where possible boost production of healthy food per hectare, with minimal usage of synthetic fertilizer and chemical pesticides. If collective efforts were made due to the several potential causes for short and long-term health problems and signs associated with exposure to pests and pesticides, documents would be hard to obtain even.</p>

IPM is a technique to make sure economic practicality at both consumer and manufacturer level (seller is always expected to earn a profit), ecological security through a well balanced use of all readily available pest control alternatives, and social acceptability because IPM-based food is cost effective and safe.</p>
<p>Details on how to deal with typical home pests like spiders, insects, cockroaches, ants and mice.
