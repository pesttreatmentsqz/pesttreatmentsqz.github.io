A normal risk most businesses run into is describing their business name too literally by using overused pest control terms like control, insecticide, management, and pesticide. The pest management industry is large, with over 15,000 companies serving the general public and around 150,000 pest control service workers. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, vermins, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow coats, bees and flies are typically discovered pests in our society.</p>
