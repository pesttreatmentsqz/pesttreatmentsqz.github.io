<p>In contrast, organic food production applies many of the very same concepts as IPM however restricts using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to reduce the requirement for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
<p>The worldwide quotes vary in magnitude, however it is thought roughly 25% of crops are lost to illness and pests, such as insects, fungi and other plant pathogens (FAO Crop Potential Customers and Food Situation 2009).
