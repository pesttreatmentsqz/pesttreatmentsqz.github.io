<p>Biological control has actually been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with intrusive pest problems, classical biological control technique is usually used where natural opponents from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ).
