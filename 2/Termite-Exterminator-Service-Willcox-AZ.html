<p>Aids on pesticides were lowered from 75% in 1986 to 40% in 1987 and eliminated altogether by January 1989 (APO 1993). Biological control - indicates a common way of damaging pests as it takes place in nature. Early detection of arthropod pests helps avoid the requirement to handle substantial populations that might trigger crop damage. Security issues and environmental interruptions continue to occur (Wright, 1996 ), and there are restored appeals for efficient, safe, and economically acceptable options (Benbrook, 1996 ).
