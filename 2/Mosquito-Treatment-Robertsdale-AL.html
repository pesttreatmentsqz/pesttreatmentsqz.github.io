<p>Biological control has been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to invasive pest issues, classical biological control approach is typically used where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control method that has actually been successfully used versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
<p>Kaolin particle films used in natural farming might control some pests, but can negatively impact natural enemies and cause other pests to proliferate (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices might encourage natural enemy populations, however a higher number of natural enemies does not always result in pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling utilize nonrenewable fuel sources and indirectly have a negative effect on the environment.</p>
