<p>If pesticides are necessary, they are selected and applied in a manner that prevents interrupting other IPM practices. Almost every kind of pest poses a danger to the properties they occupy, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the application of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or highly defined Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>
<p>Socio-psychological aspects consisting of logical and ethical considerations were found to the chauffeurs in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease event and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise showed that a lack of qualified IPM experts and extension educators was an impediment for IPM execution in developed countries.</p>
