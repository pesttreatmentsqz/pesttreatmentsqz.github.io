<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been suggested as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not take off because growers were not all set for such an intercropping plan. If your center presently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be shocked to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to approach least-impact services and products.</p>
