<p>The method to be picked for IPM depends upon many factors, the important of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and economic element of the management. Insect pests cause considerable losses to food and fiber crops worldwide. If fundamental house hygiene is overlooked, the results of other kinds of pest control will be extremely temporary as the pests will soon be back, and in greater numbers.</p>
<p>Part of this success came from field schools which permitted local farmers to harness their indigenous understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the choice and use of pest control actions that will ensure favourable financial condition, social and ecological consequences 13 and is applicable to many farming, public health and feature pest management scenarios.</p>
