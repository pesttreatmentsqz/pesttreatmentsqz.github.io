<p>If it was not extensively adopted, all nations acknowledged IPM as a desirable technique to pest control even. Pests are a major hazard that damage crops and turn farmers' efforts into a wild-goose chase and resources. Biological insecticides, derived from naturally taking place bacteria (e.g.-- Bt, entomopathogenic nematodes and entomopathogenic fungi ), likewise fall in this category.</p>
<p>The report talks about the value of pest control along with the dangers of pesticide use. Additionally, numerous approaches of biological control can be used including sterilisation programs.

If a lot of the pests are killed, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the genetic basis of the future, more resistant, population.
