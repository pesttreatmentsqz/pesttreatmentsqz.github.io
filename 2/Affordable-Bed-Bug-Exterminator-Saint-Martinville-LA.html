<p>With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will get the job done and be the most safe for other organisms and for water, air, and soil quality; use pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a few weeds rather of an entire area. Due to any variety of reasons, consisting of those discussed in the Chemical and Cultural areas, jeopardizing the efficiency of natural enemies typically enables possible pest organisms to experience virtually unregulated population growth and allows them to reach pest status. </p>
