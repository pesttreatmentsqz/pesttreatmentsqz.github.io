<h3>Pest Control In My Area Livermore CA 94550</h3>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family insect pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost specifically about lowering pesticide use. If all other incorporated pest management methods are unable to keep an insect pest population listed below an economic limit, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid economic loss is warranted.</p>
<p>Pest control products are selected and applied in a manner that decreases risks to human health, nontarget and beneficial organisms, and the environment.

The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has been effectively used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
