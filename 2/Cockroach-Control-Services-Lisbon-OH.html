IPM addresses all the economic, ecological, and social aspects and provides safe and budget friendly food to the profits and customers to manufacturers and sellers, while maintaining ecological health.</p>
<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides utilized in a natural system are as harmful to human beings and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control specialists can only do so much to secure the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The fact is, food business operators have to take an active function in incorporated pest management by working carefully with the specialists.</p>
<p>. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a broad-based and sustainable technique that integrates practices for the financial avoidance and control of pests and diseases in crops.
