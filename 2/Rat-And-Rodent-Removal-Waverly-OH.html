They also permit a pest control expert to confidently handle an industrial place understanding that he or she will receive an alert when a pest ends up being caught in a trap, permitting instant action which is critical for places like a food warehouse or an apartment building.</p>

<p>It is an ecosystem approach to crop production and defense that combines various management strategies and practices to grow healthy crops and reduce using pesticides. IPM coordinates using pest biology, environmental information, and readily available technology to prevent inappropriate levels of pest damage by the most affordable means, while reducing risk to people, property, resources, and the environment.</p>
<p>In referral to the concept of integrating making use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later expanded to embrace coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have greater levels of resistance. </p>
<p>A biological control program can be successful if these suggestions are followed: 1) correctly identify all arthropod pests, 2) purchase natural opponents from a trusted biological control supplier, 3) make sure there is a consistent supply of high quality natural opponents, 4) stress that correct shipping treatments be followed, and 5) acquire directions from biological control providers on proper release rates and timing of application.</p>
