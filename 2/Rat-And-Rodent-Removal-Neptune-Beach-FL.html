<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the environment as a whole and takes into account a well balanced mix of the abovementioned control techniques to produce the most efficient and least harmful strategy.</p>

Non-synthetic or natural pesticides: Botanical-based pesticides fall under this IPM group. Risk for animals - pesticides eliminate non-target (harmless or useful) species that habituate in the orchards or fields. These pests are simply anywhere and all over, be it houses, workplaces, companies, dining locations, hotels etc, anywhere which is not really kept properly and is not sanitary. </p>
