<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides utilized in a natural system are as harmful to human beings and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control professionals can just do so much to secure the food supply," states Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The truth is, food business operators need to take an active function in incorporated pest management by working carefully with the professionals.</p>
<p>The term "incorporated" was thus associated with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be used only after routine tracking suggested that a pest population had reached a level (the financial threshold) that needed treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which economic losses would exceed the cost of the control steps.</p>
<p>Also, think about how the range of plants to be grown in the exact same location may affect ease of pesticide applications and spread of disease. Pest control involves non-lethal techniques too, such as keeping the location clean and complimentary of any food debris or other attractants, sealing up entry methods such as cracks in walls or the area in between the bottom of the floor and a door. </p>
