For that reason, a simple switch to nontoxic pesticides, such as microbials or inundative releases of natural opponents, although valuable in reducing ecological contamination and security problems, still does not truly resolve the environmentally based weakness of the conventional pest control technique.</p>

For example, strains of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thereby increasing the likelihood that some will survive insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
