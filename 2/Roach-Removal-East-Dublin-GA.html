<h3>The Truth About Termites and Pest Control East Dublin GA</h3>
<p>It is very hard to manage specific plant illness and arthropod pests through nonchemical methods in some crops (Flinckh et al. 2006 ).

Using pesticides to crops, animals, structures or landscapes on a routine basis, regardless of requirement, is not IPM. The reliance on pesticides as a sole technique of control has resulted in the advancement of insect resistance and negative effects on human health, natural enemies, and the environment.</p>
