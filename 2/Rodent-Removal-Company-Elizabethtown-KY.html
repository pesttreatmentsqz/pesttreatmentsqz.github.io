<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address invasive pest concerns, classical biological control technique is typically utilized where natural opponents from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ).
