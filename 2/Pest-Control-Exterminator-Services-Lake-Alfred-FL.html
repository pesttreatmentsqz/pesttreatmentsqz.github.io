<p>Due to the fact that the term IPM has actually been coopted by the chemical market to suggest essentially anything a professional desires it to suggest, Beyond Pesticides has actually accepted the expression Ecological Pest Management."

<p>To ensure least impact of our pest treatments on surroundings, we utilize products that cause least impact on the environment.

Select a pesticide that is pest specific, if offered; keep in mind, do not kill the helpful insects. But the exterminators not only assist you in getting rid of the pests from your home, but they ensure the pests will not come again. IPM worries using non-chemical control approaches, such as exemption or trapping, before chemical alternatives.</p>
<p>The habits of the pest can be exploited for its tracking and control through baits, traps, and breeding disturbance strategies (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ).
