Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been picked either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to possess higher levels of resistance.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural opponents and dissuade pest determination consist of intercropping (numerous crops in the exact same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with choose application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
