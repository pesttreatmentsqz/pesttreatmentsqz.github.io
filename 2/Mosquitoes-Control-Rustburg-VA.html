<p>More information is required about food-chain concentration and useful methods of getting rid of detrimental results of pesticide residues that might remain in the environment after the pesticides have served their function.

<p>The lots of varying risks from pests make it advisable for cultural heritage organizations to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their buildings and collections. In these nations, routine usage of pesticides is restricted to high value (money) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mainly centered on cotton, rice, soybean, and sugarcane.</p>
