<p>More information is required about food-chain concentration and useful methods of getting rid of detrimental results of pesticide residues that might remain in the environment after the pesticides have served their function. Don't base pest management programs on total elimination of a pest. Pests attack plants from all over: rodents and nematode ruin roots in the earth, snails, and larvae ruin leaves and berries originating from the ground, and birds eat up fruit and seeds assaulting from the air.</p>
<p>The lots of varying risks from pests make it advisable for cultural heritage organizations to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their buildings and collections. In these nations, routine usage of pesticides is restricted to high value (money) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mainly centered on cotton, rice, soybean, and sugarcane.</p>
