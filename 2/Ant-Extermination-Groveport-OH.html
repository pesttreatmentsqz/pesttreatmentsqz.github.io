IPM intends to keep using pesticides and other forms of intervention only to levels that are financially and environmentally warranted and which reduce or minimize risk to human health and the environment.</p>
<p>The success of control tactics need to be determined using indicators based on monitoring of hazardous organisms, beneficials, pesticide usage, and impact on the environment. These consist of the renewal of pest populations after decimation of the natural enemies, advancement of insecticide-resistant populations, and unfavorable effect on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>
