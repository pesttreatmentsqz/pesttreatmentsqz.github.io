<p>Besides this, most of the pest control companies have some fix charges for couple of particular areas. Natural or non-synthetic pesticides: Botanical-based pesticides fall into this IPM group. Risk for animals - pesticides eliminate non-target (harmless or beneficial) species that habituate in the orchards or fields.

<p>Using info about pests' biology and habits, along with a toolbox of pest management strategies, pest control workers find, determine, and eliminate pests.
