<p>Besides this, most of the pest control companies have some fix charges for couple of particular areas. Natural or non-synthetic pesticides: Botanical-based pesticides fall into this IPM group. Risk for animals - pesticides eliminate non-target (harmless or beneficial) species that habituate in the orchards or fields.
