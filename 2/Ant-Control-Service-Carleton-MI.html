<p>The habits of the pest can be made use of for its monitoring and control through baits, traps, and breeding disturbance techniques (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). Baits including harmful product will bring in and kill the pests when distributed in the field or positioned in traps.</p>
