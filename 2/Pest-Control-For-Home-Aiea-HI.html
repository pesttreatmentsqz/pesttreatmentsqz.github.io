<p>There is no clear scientific evidence that consuming crop products derived from genetically engineered plants has triggered destructive impacts to humans or animals (e.g., 75% of all cheeses contain chymosin, which is, and has actually been for a long time, produced with genetically engineered bacteria). In numerous establishing nations, where IPM is now governmental policy, pesticide use is being minimized.</p>
