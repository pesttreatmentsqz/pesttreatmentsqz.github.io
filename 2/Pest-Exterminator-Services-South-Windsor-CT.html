Members of all departments or areas should be consisted of on the IPPM committee, which monitors the collection of pest monitoring data and the implementation of specific control and avoidance programs.</p>
<p>In reference to the idea of integrating the use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on broadened to embrace collaborated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to possess higher levels of resistance. </p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and dissuade pest persistence include intercropping (multiple crops in the same field) to make it harder for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests away from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
